Automates betting on [CSGODouble](http://www.csgodouble.com/) (works with [CSGOPolygon](http://csgopolygon.com/)).\r\n\r\nProgram interface\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://imgur.com/ydy6NUe.png)\r\n![Screenshot](http://imgur.com/K5DiQXS.png)\r\n\r\n Full site dark mode\r\n\r\n![Screenshot](http://imgur.com/IvhxJ1f.png)\r\n\r\n## [![Install Script](https://i.imgur.com/hKHfyWz.png)](https://github.com/sakox/SakoxCSGODobuleBot/raw/master/csgodouble.com-automated.user.js)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nRequires [Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) on Firefox and [Tampermonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) on Chrome.\r\nor Copy and paste the .js text in your browsers console\r\n\r\n## Is it safe?\r\n\r\nYes, you can use this script and don't worry about CSGODouble banning you - firstly, they don't really lose anything on you, secondary, checking for such activity is really troublesome.\r\nFeel free to donate to me /send 76561198216315975 XXXX\r\n\r\n## About\r\nThe script has a multiple of methods to bet! The newest method is off 2 train, also made up by myself. Basically it waits for a color to appear 2 times before betting against the train with martingale system.\r\nThe script uses martingale to bet your coins, this means that with every lose it doubles bet value, changing it back to base after win. That, in theory, means you always win base value.\r\n\r\n#### Why in theory?\r\n\r\nIn theory, because the situation takes player with infinite wealth (in our case - `coins`). With every lost bet the value is doubled - let's take `1` as base, here is possible scenario, 16 loses in a row:\r\n```\r\n 1 | Value:     1 | Total amount invested:      1 | Result: Lose\r\n 2 | Value:     2 | Total amount invested:      3 | Result: Lose\r\n 3 | Value:     4 | Total amount invested:      7 | Result: Lose\r\n 4 | Value:     8 | Total amount invested:     15 | Result: Lose\r\n...\r\n12 | Value:  2048 | Total amount invested:   4095 | Result: Lose\r\n...\r\n16 | Value: 32768 | Total amount invested:  65535 | Result: Lose\r\n17 | Value: 65536 | Total amount invested: 131071 | Result: Win\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, it took `132071` coins just to get base `1` coin back.\r\n\r\n#### Why don't you code 'train protection' (or any different form of protection) then?\r\n\r\nIf you ask such question, you don't even understand what is so-called `train/rainbow/anything protection` and why it is bullshit (in other words - doesn't work).\r\n\r\nLet me show you another example, we are betting on `red`, here is current result history:\r\n```\r\nred, red, black, red, green, black, black, black, black, black\r\n```\r\nWhat should the script do in that situation - keep with red, switch to black?\r\nThe answer is - whatever it does the winning chance is exactly the same.\r\nYou may say something like - \"Why?! You can see many streaks on the site, it is impossible!\".\r\nWell, it is possible, the site uses a system which chose `random` (at least very close to be random) number.\r\n\r\nLet's simplify it to a coin toss (which is pretty similar) - we have 50% chance for heads, 50% chance for tails*.\r\nWe start tossing. Heads. What are the chances, after the first toss? 50/50! Tossing it again (and again...) won't change the chance a bit.\r\n\r\n#### Does that mean I may lose everything in one unlucky streak?\r\n\r\nYes. That is what I'm trying to say. That also means you will eventually *lose everything* using this algorithm (algorithm, not the script itself, applies to any other script using this system).\r\nTo cheer you up a bit I can say that within gambling's very nature lays the possiblity of losing everything. All you can do is to play safe and use only funds you can afford to lose!\r\n\r\n#### Why would I play the game if i can lose everything?\r\n\r\nBecause that doesn't mean you may not earn anything - calculate base value depending on your balance and risk you want to take.\r\n\r\n**How to calculate**\r\n\r\n``floor(balance / 2^(loses_in_a_row_you_want_to_cover + 1))``\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n```\r\nBalance: 10000\r\nSafety: Medium, want to be safe even if the streak is 8 turns long\r\nBase value: floor(10000/2^9) = 19\r\n```\r\n```\r\nBalance: 250000\r\nSafety: High-medium, want to be safe with 12 turns long streaks\r\nBase value: floor(250000/2^13) = 30\r\n```\r\n```\r\nBalance: 5000000\r\nSafety: High, you are risking a lot of money, you want to be safe with 15 turns long streaks\r\nBase value: floor(5000000/2^16) = 76\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Okay, I think I understand... But why are streaks so common?\r\n\r\nRemember, as the site uses computer randomness, it may feel strange, but that os how it works.\r\nAs a human you wouldn't except more than X `reds` in a row, because you are counting 10, 20, maybe 100 rolls and the outcome should give equal chances for both colors, but keep in mind that machine counts *thousands* more times rolls than you can - if in your calculations (100 rolls) `reds` may be chosen 2 times in a row, what is wrong with 20 `reds` streak in thousands of rolls?\r\n\r\nIn fact streaks like that are more natural for real randomness than you probably think, that is why people may call the site rigged, but it is not (I'm not defending the site, just the algorithm itself).\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Why is 'Rainbow' set as the default option?\r\n\r\nBecause when you look on the history, you may think it's the safest option to go rainbow - the site don't pay me enough (in fact - they don't pay me at all :anguished:) to say it's true, but... Well, you may feel better!\r\n\r\n*[They say it is not, but we don't care, right?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYnJv68T3MM)\r\n",
